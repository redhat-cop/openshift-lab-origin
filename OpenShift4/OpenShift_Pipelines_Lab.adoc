= OpenShift Pipelines Lab

This lab explores the use of OpenShift Pipelines on OpenShift Container Platform.

== Set up Source Code repositories

You will use a simple application during this lab, which has a frontend and backend. While you could deploy the applications by applying the artifacts available in k8s directory of the respective repo you will use a pipeline task to create the application in case it doesn't exist yet.

. From your studentVM clone the two source code repositories that make up the application into the directory `$HOME/pipelines`:
+
[source,sh]
----
cd $HOME
mkdir pipelines
cd pipelines
git clone https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/vote-api.git
git clone https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/vote-ui.git
----

. In your Gogs instance create a new organization *Pipeline*
. In that organization create two new repositories: `vote-api` and `vote-ui`. Leave the repositories public.
. From your student VM push the `vote-api` and `vote-ui` repositories to your Gogs instance:
+
[source,sh]
----
cd $HOME/pipelines/vote-api
git remote add gogs $(oc get route gogs-gogs -n $GUID-gogs --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')/pipeline/vote-api
git push gogs master

cd $HOME/pipelines/vote-ui
git remote add gogs $(oc get route gogs-gogs -n $GUID-gogs --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')/pipeline/vote-ui
git push gogs master
----

. Create a new project `$GUID-pipeline`
+
[source,sh]
----
oc new-project $GUID-pipeline
----

. OpenShift Pipelines automatically adds and configures a ServiceAccount named pipeline in every project. This service account has sufficient permissions to build and push an image.
+
Run the following command to see the pipeline service account:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get serviceaccount pipeline
----

== Install Custom Tasks

. OpenShift Pipelines already installs a few common *ClusterTasks* into the OpenShift cluster. You can list the available cluster tasks using the `tkn` command line utility:
+
[source,sh]
----
tkn clustertasks ls
----
+

. Examine the `openshift-client` cluster task:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get clustertask openshift-client -o yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]

    name: oc
    resources: {}
    script: $(params.SCRIPT)
----
+
Note the following settings:

* The task uses an image `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/cli:latest`
* The task expects two parameters: `SCRIPT` and `ARGS`, both of which have defaults.
* There is one optional resource, `source`. This can be used to clone a repository with YAML manifests first in case the task needs to create objects from YAML.
* The task has one step, named `oc` that calls the OpenShift CLI image passing the parameter `SCRIPT`.

. You can also create your own tasks in order to execute steps that have no pre-built task available.
+
Create a new Task to apply k8s manifests to your cluster
+
[source,sh]
----
cat << 'EOF' >$HOME/pipelines/task_apply_manifests.yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: apply-manifests
spec:
  params:
  - default: k8s
    description: The directory in source that contains yaml manifests
    name: manifest_dir
    type: string
  steps:
  - args:
    - |-
      echo Applying manifests in $(params.manifest_dir) directory
      oc apply -f $(params.manifest_dir)
      echo -----------------------------------
    command:
    - /bin/bash
    - -c
    image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/cli:latest
    name: apply
    resources: {}
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
  workspaces:
  - name: source
EOF
----

. Examine the task definition to understand what it does.
. Create a second task that will update the container image in a deployment:
+
[source,sh]
----
cat << 'EOF' >$HOME/pipelines/task_update_deployment.yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: update-deployment
spec:
  params:

    type: string
  steps:
  - args:
    - |-
      oc patch deployment $(params.deployment) --patch='{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{
        "containers":[{
          "name": "$(params.deployment)",
          "image":"$(params.image)"
        }]
      }}}}'
    command:
    - /bin/bash
    - -c
    image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/cli:latest
    name: patch
    resources: {}
EOF
----

. Once again examine the task definition to understand how it works.
. Create the two tasks:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f $HOME/pipelines/task_apply_manifests.yaml
oc create -f $HOME/pipelines/task_update_deployment.yaml
----

. Validate that your tasks have been created:
+
[source,sh]
----
tkn task ls
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
NAME                AGE
apply-manifests     5 seconds ago
update-deployment   5 seconds ago
----

. Since tasks are Kubernetes resources you can also use the OpenShift CLI to validate your tasks have been created:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get tasks
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
NAME                AGE
apply-manifests     34s
update-deployment   34s
----

== Create Pipeline

In the next section you will create a Pipeline that uses the two tasks you created as well as the common `buildah` task to build the container image for the two applications.

Pipelines, just like tasks, are designed to be reusable. You will only create one pipeline - and then use parameters to select which application to build and deploy.

Here is a diagram of the pipeline that you will create.

image::images/pipeline-diagram.png[width=100%]

In the box on the right you see the pipeline with the following steps:

* Using the `buildah` task clone the source code from Gogs, build the container image and push it to the OpenShift registry
* Apply the Kubernetes manifests from the source code repository to create / update the application
* Update the Deployment to use the recently built container image (which will trigger a redeploy of the application)

. Create the Pipeline
+
[source,sh]
----
cat << 'EOF' >$HOME/pipelines/pipeline.yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: build-and-deploy
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: shared-workspace
    description: The git repo will be cloned into this workspace.
  params:
  - name: git-url
    type: string
    description: URL of the git repository
  - name: git-revision
    description: revision to be used from repo of the code for deployment
    type: string
    default: ""

    - name: revision
      value: $(params.git-revision)
  - name: build-image
    taskRef:
      name: buildah
      kind: ClusterTask
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace
    params:
    - name: TLSVERIFY
      value: "false"
    - name: IMAGE
      value: $(params.image-url)
    runAfter:
    - fetch-repository
  - name: apply-manifests
    taskRef:
      name: apply-manifests
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace
    runAfter:
    - build-image
  - name: update-deployment
    taskRef:
      name: update-deployment
    params:
    - name: deployment
      value: $(params.deployment-name)
    - name: image
      value: $(params.image-url)
    runAfter:
    - apply-manifests
EOF
----

. Examine the pipeline and note the following:
.. You defined three parameters: a git repository URL, an image URL, and a deployment name
.. You might have noticed that there are no references to the actual git repository or image registry in the pipeline. That's because pipeline in Tekton are designed to be generic and re-usable across environments and stages through the application's lifecycle. Pipelines abstract away the specifics of the git source repository and image to be produced as parameters.
.. There are three tasks listed, with their inputs
.. The execution order of task is determined by dependencies that are defined between the tasks via inputs and outputs as well as explicit orders that are defined via runAfter.

. Create the pipeline:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f $HOME/pipelines/pipeline.yaml
----

. Check that the pipeline has been created:
+
[source,sh]
----
tkn pipeline ls
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]

----

== Validate the Pipeline in the OpenShift Console

The OpenShift Pipelines Operator has also created a new section in the OpenShift Console to create, update and view pipelines. In this section you examine the pipeline from the web console.

. Log into the OpenShift Web Console
. Switch your perspective to the *Developer* perspective
. Make sure you are in *your* project, `$GUID-pipeline`
. Navigate to `Pipelines` on the left.
. Explore your pipeline.
. When you are finished leave the OpenShift web console open. You will use the Pipelines view in the Web Console in the next section to follow the execution of your pipeline.

== Execute the Pipeline

Before you can execute your pipeline you have to create the inputs and outputs for your pipelines. These are defined in `PipelineResource` objects.

. Create a pipeline run template for the `vote-ui` application:
+
[source,sh]
----
export GOGS_ROUTE=$(oc get route gogs-gogs -n $GUID-gogs --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')

echo "
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: build-and-deploy-run-
spec:
  params:
  - name: git-url
    value: ${GOGS_ROUTE}/Pipeline/vote-ui.git
  - name: image-url
    value: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/$GUID-pipeline/vote-ui:latest
  - name: deployment-name
    value: vote-ui
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-and-deploy
  workspaces:
  - name: shared-workspace
    volumeClaimTemplate:
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 50Mi
" >$HOME/pipelines/pr_vote_ui.yaml
----

. Create another pipeline run template for the `vote-api` application:
+
[source,sh]
----
echo "
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: build-and-deploy-run-
spec:
  params:
  - name: git-url
    value: ${GOGS_ROUTE}/Pipeline/vote-api.git
  - name: image-url
    value: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/$GUID-pipeline/vote-api:latest
  - name: deployment-name
    value: vote-api
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-and-deploy
  workspaces:
  - name: shared-workspace
    volumeClaimTemplate:
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 50Mi
" >$HOME/pipelines/pr_vote_api.yaml
----

. You are now ready to run your pipeline for the first time.
+
Create a `PipelineRun` by importing the `vote-api` pipeline run template we created earlier:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f $HOME/pipelines/pr_vote_api.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
Pipelinerun started: build-and-deploy-run-l52wd

In order to track the pipelinerun progress run:
tkn pipelinerun logs build-and-deploy-run-l52wd -f -n a4c4-pipeline
----

. Validate that your pipeline is running (you can also check the OpenShift web console):
+
[source,sh]
----
tkn pipeline list
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
NAME               AGE              LAST RUN                     STARTED          DURATION   STATUS
build-and-deploy   21 minutes ago   build-and-deploy-run-wj26p   19 seconds ago   ---        Running
----

. Follow the logs of the pipeline (if you have more than one pipeline running tkn will ask you for which pipeline run you want to tail the logs):
+
[source,sh]
----
tkn pipeline logs -f

Note the following:

* Your `vote-api` pod is now running
* You have three other, completed, pods. These were the three tasks in your pipeline: *build image*, *apply manifests* and *update deployment*.
* The tasks get executed as pods - and each step in a task gets executed in its own container. You can tell that the *build image* task had 5 steps.

. Now build the second application. You will use the exact same pipeline - but with different inputs (resources and parameters):

== Adding Triggers to your Pipeline

Triggers enable us to configure pipelines to respond to external events (github push events, pull requests etc).

Adding triggering support requires the creation of a *TriggerTemplate*, *TriggerBinding*, and an *EventListener* in our project.

A trigger template is a template for newly created resources. It supports parameters to create specific pipeline resources and pipeline runs. The parameters are later set via a trigger binding.

. Create a trigger template called `vote-app`:
+

* The trigger template is generic. You can use the same trigger template for the `vote-api` and `vote-ui` applications.
* The template expects three parameters: `git-repo-url`, `git-revision` and `git-repo-name`. These parameters will be set by the trigger binding that we will create next.
* It creates two pipeline resources, one of type git that points to the repository that triggered the event. The other one points to the container image to be built (which has the same name as your repository)
* It creates a pipeline run that uses the generic pipeline `build-and-deploy` and binds the newly created resources for our repo and image.
* Finally it sets the `deployment-name` variable to the name of the repository that triggered the build.

. Replace the GUID placeholder in the file with your actual GUID:
+
[source,sh]
----
sed -i "s/GUID/${GUID}/g" $HOME/pipelines/trigger_template.yaml
----

. A trigger binding is a map that enables you to capture fields from an event and store them as parameters, and replace them in a trigger template whenever an event occurs.

. Every time the event is triggered Gogs will call the URL of your event listener and pass information via JSON data.

* You will need the following values from the payload - `body` is the top level path to be used in path queries:
** URL of the repository (because the task will need to clone the repository): `body.repository.html_url`
** Commit ID (because that is the exact version of the repository to be checked out): `body.after`
** Name of the repository (because that maps onto the image name as well as the application name): `body.repository.name`
. Create a trigger binding:
+
[source,sh]
----
cat << 'EOF' >$HOME/pipelines/trigger_binding.yaml
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerBinding
metadata:
  name: vote-app
spec:
  params:
  - name: git-repo-url
    value: $(body.repository.html_url)
  - name: git-repo-name
    value: $(body.repository.name)
  - name: git-revision
    value: $(body.after)
EOF
----
+
The exact variables for the values that we need can be found by examining the event payload (eg: GitHub events). In this example we set the parameter `git-repo-url` to the value `body.repository.html_url` from the JSON payload. Compare the rest of the fields to the example payload from above.

. An event listener sets up a service and listens for events. It also connects a trigger template to a trigger binding.
+
Create the event listener:
+
[source,sh]
----
cat << 'EOF' >$HOME/pipelines/event_listener.yaml
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EventListener
metadata:
  name: vote-app
spec:
  serviceAccountName: pipeline
  triggers:
    - template:
        name: vote-app
      bindings:
        - ref: vote-app
EOF
----
+
Notice how the Event Listener uses the trigger binding `vote-app` and the trigger template `vote-app`. This means that every time an event is received the trigger template `vote-app` is being instantiated with the values from the trigger binding. And this creates both the pipeline resources as well as the pipeline run.

. Now create the trigger template, trigger binding and event listener:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f $HOME/pipelines/trigger_template.yaml
oc create -f $HOME/pipelines/trigger_binding.yaml
oc create -f $HOME/pipelines/event_listener.yaml
----

. Validate that the event listener has indeed created a service:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get svc
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
el-vote-app   ClusterIP   172.30.171.242   <none>        8080/TCP         3s
vote-api      ClusterIP   172.30.96.18     <none>        9000/TCP         22m
vote-ui       NodePort    172.30.8.124     <none>        8080:30183/TCP   16m
----

. Expose the event listener service as a route so that it can be called from outside of the OpenShift Cluster (even though we could have used the service because Gogs is on the same cluster as the pipeline):
+
[source,sh]
----
oc expose svc el-vote-app
----

. Retrieve the URL for the event listener:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get route el-vote-app --template='http://{{.spec.host}}'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
http://el-vote-app-a4c4-pipeline.apps.cluster-navilt.navilt.example.opentlc.com
----

== Set up Web Hook in Gogs

Now that everything is prepared on the OpenShift pipelines side it is time to configure Gogs to call the web hook whenever code gets pushed into the repository.

. Log back into your Gogs instance
. Navigate to the `vote-ui` repository.
. Click *Settings* to configure the repository
. Click *Webhooks* in the navigation area on the left
. Click the blue *Add Webhook* button and select *Gogs* as the type of Web Hook to create.
.. Use the route of your event listener as the *Payload URL*
.. Leave Content Type as *application/json*
.. And set the secret to whatever you like, e.g. *12345678*
.. Click the green *Add Webhook* button to finish.

== Trigger Web Hook

You will now make a change to the repository on your student VM and push that change to the repository. This push will trigger the webhook and therefore start another pipeline run.

. Switch to your `vote-ui` directory:
+
[source,sh]
----
cd $HOME/pipelines/vote-ui
----

. Add a line to your *README.md* file:
+
[source,sh]
----
echo "Added a line to the README" >> ./README.md
----

. Commit and push the file to the repo:
+
[source,sh]
----
git commit -m "Added line to README" README.md
git push gogs
----

. Check that your pipeline is running:
+
[source,sh]
----
tkn pipelines ls
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
NAME               AGE          LAST RUN                     STARTED          DURATION   STATUS
build-and-deploy   1 hour ago   build-deploy-vote-ui-jqzd4   39 seconds ago   ---        Running
----
+
[TIP]
If your pipeline is not running after a few seconds you can check the pod logs of your event listener pod to see if there are any error messages - for example mismatched variables.

. Back in Gogs navigate back to your web hooks page where you can see *Recent Deliveries*. If you click on the blue line it will open details on the request - including the full JSON payload. This can be useful for debugging and examining what fields are available for you to use in your trigger binding.

== Wrapup

You have created a simple, three step, pipeline using one existing and two custom tasks.

You tested the generic pipeline by adding pipeline resources and using these pipeline resources in a pipeline run to execute your generic pipeline twice - for two different applications from two different repositories

And finally you set up triggering so that every push to the repository will trigger a Pipeline Run.
