= Deploying Clusters using Hosted Control Planes

== Introduction

This Red Hat Product Demo System catalog item allows you to use, demonstrate and learn OpenShift clusters using *Hosted Control Planes* (also sometimes referred to as *Hypershift*).

[TIP]
====
If you received a link to this document and need an environment then go to the https://demo.redhat.com[RedHat Product Demo System] and find the catalog item *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management with HyperShift* in the *Demos* folder. You can also type *hypershift* into the search box to find the catalog item.

Make sure you provision an environment before continuing. Provisioning should take approximately an hour.
====

Using hosted control planes is a way to deploy the Control Plane of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters as pods on other clusters dramatically decreasing the time it takes to provision a new cluster. Worker nodes are still deployed as virtual machines and managed using the new `Machine.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1` API.

Hosted control planes are currently in Tech Preview on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes version 2.7.

The catalog item deploys the following environment::

* OpenShift Container Platform 4.14.
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) 2.9 installed and configured.
* Technology preview for HyperShift enabled and configured on RHACM.
* A small "development" cluster has been pre-deployed using hosted control planes.

The instructions cover the following scenarios:

* Introduction (this document)
* Explore the pre-installed environment (this document)
* https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-lab-origin/blob/master/HyperShift_Lab/Explore_Environment.adoc[Exploring the Environment]
* https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-lab-origin/blob/master/HyperShift_Lab/Deploy_Cluster.adoc[Deploy a cluster using HyperShift]
* https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-lab-origin/blob/master/HyperShift_Lab/Deploy_Application.adoc[Deploy an application to both clusters using RHACM]

== Documentation

Further documentation about enabling, configuring and using hosted control planes can be found at the following link:

== Information you will need

Once your environment has been provisioned the following information will be available in the service page of your Environment on the Red Hat Demo System. You will also receive an e-mail with the following information:

|===
|Console URL|https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-p6mj8.sandbox2651.opentlc.com
|Cluster admin user|admin
|Cluster admin password|EDdYfrIoygYEPP4n
|Cluster users|user1 .. user2
|Cluster user (common) password|3pNVc0JCPRZeby4i
|SSH command to connect to the bastion VM|ssh lab-user@bastion.p6mj8.sandbox2651.opentlc.com
|SSH password|YhTVpCoq1P8j
|Service Management URL|https://demo.redhat.com/services/user-wkulhane-redhat-com/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-acm-hypershift.prod
|===

Make note of the following information:

* The SSH command to connect to you environment's bastion's VM
* The password to be used with user `lab-user` on the bastion VM
* Also the OpenShift console URL along with the credentials for the `admin` user.
